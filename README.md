> ⚠️ **Early Development Stage**: This repository is in a very early stage of development. Features may be incomplete, APIs may change, and breaking changes are expected.

**🤝 We are looking for co-maintainers!**

## ✨ Features

- 🗨️ OpenAI Chat integration
- 🧩 Modular architecture for easy extensibility

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

We try to keep the root of the repo slim and add things like `package.json` file where it actually belongs to.

**Folder hierarchy:**

- **./backend/omni**: Contains the Python Backend code
- **./frontend/omni**: Universal full fledged chat frontend

## 🖥️ modAI Frontends

In modAI there is not the one-and-only frontend but we (potentially) have more than one, or even transitioning from one to another (e.g. rewrite).
Why more than one frontend: because there are different use cases. e.g. one full fledged frontend containing all features the backend offers and a second one very small chat bubble frontend which can be used to be integrated in existing sites.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+

### Backend Setup

## 🤝 Contribution

Contributions are welcome in form of pull requests, issues or discussions. If you plan to implement something new or bigger, it is advisable to start a discussion first.

## 👥 Shared Responsibility

There are plenty of successful repos out in the wild which are lead by single persons, but often this overwhelms and stresses
the maintainer and obviously leads to a very bad work-life balance.

We believe that a one-man-show is not the right way and therefore
are happy if you also want to take over responsibility. The whole
project is divided into different chunks with dedicated responsible
persons.

| Component     | Overall responsibility   |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| frontend/omni | @guenhter and maybe you? |
| backend       | @guenhter and maybe you? |
| CI/CD         | @guenhter and maybe you? |

The responsibilities for frontend and backend are defined more granular in the respective `README.md` files.
