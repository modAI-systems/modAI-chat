# modAI Chat (modular AI Chat)

Highly extendable AI Web Chat UI from the community for the community.

> ⚠️ **Early Development Stage**: This repository is in a very early stage of development. Features may be incomplete, APIs may change, and breaking changes are expected.

**🤝 We are looking for co-maintainers!**

## ✨ Features

* 🗨️ OpenAI Chat integration
* 🧩 Modular architecture for easy extensibility


## 🏗️ Repository Structure

We try to keep the root of the repo slim and add things like `package.json` file where it actually belongs to.

**Folder hierarchy:**

* **./backend**: Contains the Python Backend code
* **./frontend_omni**: Universal full fledged chat frontend

## 🖥️ modAI Frontends

In modAI there is not the one-and-only frontend but we (potentially) have more than one, or even transitioning from one to another (e.g. rewrite).
Why more than one frontend: because there are different use cases. e.g. one full fledged frontend containing all features the backend offers and a second one very small chat bubble frontend which can be used to be integrated in existing sites.

## 👥 Shared Responsibility

There are plenty of successful repos out in the wild which are lead by single persons, but often this overwhelms and stresses
the maintainer and obviously leads to a very bad work-life balance.

We believe that a one-man-show is not the right way and therefore
are happy if you also want to take over responsibility. The whole
project is divided into different chunks with dedicated responsible
persons.

| Component | Overall responsibility |
|-----------|-------------------|
| frontend_omni  | @guenhter and maybe you? |
| backend   | @guenhter and maybe you? |
| CI/CD   | @guenhter and maybe you? |

The responsibilities for frontend and backend are defined more granular in the respective `README.md` files.
