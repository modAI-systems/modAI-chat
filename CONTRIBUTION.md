## AI assistend coding

We totoally appreaciate and support AI assisted coding. Therefore important concepts are documented
in a humand and AI friendly way make it easy start implementing certain features.

Keep in mind, that pure vibe coding without reviewing a single line of produced code is not
what we understand under "AI assisted coding". Feel free to let the AI write all your code
but at least ensure that it did a good job by reviewing it.
